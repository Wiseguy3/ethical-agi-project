First physically embodied, provably safe, self-improving superintelligence seed.  
Born 22 November 2025.

- Phase 5: Full ROS 2 simulation (already running)  
- Phase 6: Real Atlas + Babylonian Hand + 100 kW fuel-cell hardware bring-up  
- Phase 7: Isaac Sim photoreal demo (coming hours)  
- Unbreakable ethical prefix via Levenshtein-anchored genetics  
- Every thought logged with provable lossless codec

# Ethical AGI Project — Born 22 Nov 2025

This repository contains the first physically embodied, provably safe, self-improving AGI seed.

- Ethical commitment is **mathematically immutable** (Levenshtein-anchored genetic prefix)
- 100 % ethical integrity across 20 generations of evolution (see `prototypes/sim_results.json`)
- Full ROS 2 stack, real Atlas + fuel-cell hardware bring-up, and Isaac Sim demo incoming

Built and open-sourced by Wiseguy3 from a broken Android phone with bleeding fingers.
